  Car ride with soundtrack playing on speakers (stereo, 17’), fake tickets and receipts
brief: >
  Visitors and passers-by of the group show in a Munich parking lot “La fange du macadam” are invited to a car drive at rush hour one Saturday evening. The car ride takes about 20 minutes and returns every time to the departure spot to drop off the passengers, take on new ones and proceed with the loop. The car is stuffed with piles of old receipts, tickets, parking bills that look like useless bits and leftovers of past drives and travels. As the journey unfolds and a soundtrack plays from the car speakers, fragments of stories of border-crossing, forgotten interiors, abandoned houses and ruins emerge both through the male voice of a undefined narrator and through the receipts and tickets themselves, which constitutes a sort of libretto, a script of the sound piece. What do we keep, when we leave a place? What sticks to us of the past? Does that place change and morph in the meantime, as some kind of autonomous self-healing body? The texts result from a research residency in Georgia and Abkhazia in Autumn 2019.
