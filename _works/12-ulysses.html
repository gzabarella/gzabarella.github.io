  <i>Fucking Ulysses!<br/>
  About a certain incapacity<br/>
  of living in the present.<br/>
  This wanting to go further ahead,<br/>
  don’t you know that the earth is spheric?<br/>
  You’ll end up on the other side of it,<br/>
  and at some point<br/>
  exactly at the same place where you started.<br/>
  In the meantime, you’ll have lost<br/>
  valuable things<br/>
  because you were looking for something else<br/>
  “further”!</i>
