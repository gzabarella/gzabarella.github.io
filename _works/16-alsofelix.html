  Performance in three parts (Prologue, Main part, Epilogue: alltogether 1 hour and 30 minutes), different stage elements: fiberboard (MDF) cellphones, water bottles, sunglasses, sportswear, egg cartons, yogurt pots, Bavarian flags.

brief: >
  Using the trope of political satire and stand-up comedy formats, the artists build a script, an “epic poem in three parts”, questioning political narratives of the everyday and their role as performing artists in their absorption, consumption and interpretation. Mixing poetic texts with articles from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, weather forecasts, stock market numbers and oscillations, the performance investigates and confuses the differences between entertainment, boredom and political information. Absurd, repetitive gestures are interwoven, like the sanding of DIY cellphones made of fiberboard (MDF), physical exercise, and the singing of limericks and wordplays  inspired by comedy sketches, from Karl Valentin to Keren Cytter. The artist duo, at times elderly couple, kids, animals, or merely talking heads in synch, exhaust themselves in the piece: trying to make sense of the daily available “objective information” while at the same time pushing it to the edge of complete saturation, Tower-of-Babel unintelligibility and chaos.
