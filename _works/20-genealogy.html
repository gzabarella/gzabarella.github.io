brief: >
  The lithographic series develops out of a previous corpus of 108 oil and wax pastel drawings (Genealogy: 108 Studien für Deutschland) produced during my time in residency at the Cité des Arts in Paris. Researching silkscreen and lithographic political pamphlets and protest posters collected in the Archives of Bibliothèque Forney from the 1950s to today, I looked at the history of international solidarity movements across continents and social contexts, investigating patterns of affiliation and reappropriation of aesthetic forms, struggles and slogans printed on banners by different political generations. The 9 chosen patterns, reproduced in lithography with slight interventions, position themselves in a direct genealogical line with such struggles, and resonate with songs and demands of current protests in 2024-25 Paris and Munich.
