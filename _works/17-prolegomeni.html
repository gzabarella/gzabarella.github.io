brief: >
  This work is the first station (“Prolegòmeni” means “introduction”) of a longer research on fascist architecture in Italy and its urban and cultural legacy today. How do architectural landmarks, monuments, and urban models built in the 1920s and 1930s under Mussolini’s regime shape people today and their understanding of public space? How do images, ornaments, and inscriptions on public buildings influence cultural and national identity? These questions are the starting point of my research project “Materlingua”. I plan to collect materials in different places in Italy, from North to South, that still embody the traces of fascist cultural domination in architecture and urban planning. At the first stop in South Tyrol (during a residency at Longega Project, near Bolzano), I collected materials from the so-called Alpini Monument in Brunico, the Casa del Fascio, the Palace of Justice, and the Victory Monument in Bolzano. In the looped videocollage, these fragments are juxtaposed as seven chapters or scenes and shown as research material; in the lecture-performance, in a destroyed house nearby, the history of these monuments and their conflicted legacy in South Tyrol is interwoven with poetic explorations of issues of creolization and border politics. Ladino (the language of the Val Badia), Italian, German and English intertwine in the text and articulate the question of translation as a political instrument of both emancipation and oppression.
