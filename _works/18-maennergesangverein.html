  A public rehearsal of the local men's choral society (founded in 1896 in Ismaning, Bavaria) forms the musical soundtrack of this short film. In it, three "players" exist in a parallel reality and perform actions in slow motion. Their awkward speed becomes even clearer when other players (random passers-by, the wind, insects) overlay their actions. Stretched out in time, everyday actions (resting, drinking, going for a walk, playing soccer) become an alienated, artificial or simply absurd dance. The slapstick look of the manual, live and temporally stretched body movements competes with the usual software-generated and post-produced slow-motion aesthetics. The voices of the men's choral society (consisting of around 70 male members, all between 40 and 80 years old) and their choirmaster guide the strange trio through their activities. Both the soccer training and the singing exercises are led by the same principles of order, melody, discipline and striving for professionalism through repetition.
