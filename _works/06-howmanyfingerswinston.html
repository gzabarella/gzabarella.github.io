  “How many fingers, Winston?” is a quotation from one of the last chapters of “1984”, the Orwellian novel in which the main character, Winston, undergoes torture and brainwashing and is then made uncapable to clearly distinguish real from fiction, true from fake. This work was conceived for “Ein Nachspiel / An Epilogue”, filmscreening and cooperation between AdBK students, Alexander Kluge and Public Art Munich 2018, in the framework of the 50-years anniversary of the students and workers riots in Munich in 1968. Concepts of legacy and narrative are at stake when these historical events appear to be often seen through a nostalgic and celebratory filter, deliberately forgetful of any ambivalence, violence or contradiction. French, German and English fragments of activist slogans, newspaper articles, graffitis and political statements (from Pasolini to Charles de Gaulle, from the Situationists to anonymous students, from Paris to Rome and Munich) melt together in the work, where oppositions and polarities almost reset. In a disconnected and aggressive audio-recording, a cacophonic, hallucinatory Tower of Babel, and in playful-looking posters spread throughout the city of Munich, these statements are repeated, chewed and tossed out again. They become powerless slogans, harmless children advertisment, whose encounter in public space can raise questions about the power of politics and the reshaping, recycling, re-trending of history.
