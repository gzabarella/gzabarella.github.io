brief: >
  Tawny Pipit: archive of disappearance (working title) is a work-in-progress short film shot by Sol Archer and Giulia Zabarella in the small town of Sacile (North-Eastern Italy) in September 2024. Since at least the XIII century, Sacile has hosted so-called “chioccolo” competitions, migratory bird call imitation contests, which celebrate both the seasonal arrival of migratory birds, and the extraordinary skill of subsistence farmers whose culture and diet depended for centuries on catching and trapping birds through the convincing imitation of their calls and songs.
