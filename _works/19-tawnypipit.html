  Tawny Pipit: archive of disappearance (working title) is a work-in-progress short film shot by Sol Archer and Giulia Zabarella in the small town of Sacile (North-Eastern Italy) in September 2024. Since at least the XIII century, Sacile has hosted so-called “chioccolo” competitions, migratory bird call imitation contests, which celebrate both the seasonal arrival of migratory birds, and the extraordinary skill of subsistence farmers whose culture and diet depended for centuries on catching and trapping birds through the convincing imitation of their calls and songs. In the past 30 years local migratory patterns and bird populations have majorly suffered from the massive impact of environmental change and degradation, industrial monocultural practices, and invasive architecture policies, resulting in the sonic scenography of the seasons drastically fading. Bringing the centuries old tradition of chioccolo into relation with such tangible environmental damage, Sol and Giulia proposed to this year’s chioccolo competitors to include in their traditional repertoire some of the migratory bird populations which have recently become critically endangered in the area: yellowhammer (zigolo giallo), woodlark (tottavilla), skylark (allodola), cetti’s warbler (usignolo di fiume), barn swallow (rondine), wryneck (torcicollo), house sparrow (passero domestico), common linnet (fanello), greater short-toed lark (calandrella). The film intends to be a collectively embodied archive of bird calls as they disappear from the landscape, at the same time celebrating the tools and traditions families of the region have used to mediate the relationship between human and non-human worlds for centuries. As both bird populations decrease and the traditional practice of chioccolo becomes less of a proper hunting skill and more a competition of bravura alone, the film delves in issues of cultural identity and loss, territorial belonging and folk history.
