brief: >
  The shared project is a work-in-progress documentary / ethnofiction shot by Sol Archer and Giulia Zabarella in the small town of Sacile (North-Eastern Italy) in September 2024. Since at least the 13th century, Sacile has hosted so-called “chioccolo” competitions, migratory bird call imitation contests, which celebrate both the seasonal arrival of migratory birds, and the extraordinary skill of subsistence farmers whose culture and diet depended on catching and trapping birds through the convincing imitation of their calls and songs. In the past 30 years, local migratory patterns and bird populations have majorly suffered from the massive impact of environmental change and degradation, industrial monocultural practices, and invasive architecture, resulting in the sonic scenography of the seasons drastically fading. Bringing the centuries old tradition of chioccolo into relation with such tangible environmental damage, we asked this year’s chioccolo competitors to embody in their traditional repertoire some of the migratory bird populations which have recently become critically endangered in the region, like the songs of the yellowhammer, the woodlark, the barn swallow or the house sparrow. The film intends to be an embodied archive of bird calls as they disappear from the landscape, at the same time celebrating the tools and performance traditions families of the region have used to mediate the relationship between human and non-human worlds for centuries. As both bird populations decrease and the traditional practice of chioccolo becomes more of an abstract language and less of a hunting skill, the project delves in issues of cultural identity and loss, territorial belonging and folk history.
