brief: >
  The 2-channel videowork is based on a script enacted by 2 voices, its material stemming from diary entries, newspapers headlines, conversation with friends and 35 mm snapshots collected in the last 365 days between Paris, Tbilisi and Munich. The work reflects on the search for transnational solidarity in times of political upheaval, and interrogates the shifts and fractures between 1st person singular and 1st person plural; (self)-censorship and self-policing; and how the rehearsal of bodies in public space continuously morphs and is rearranged by memory, trauma, opportunism, and fanaticism. A mixtape produced by Georgian musician Nana Takvarelia accompanies the work, made of field recordings, noises and chants collected during the anti-government, pro-European protests and marches that have been taking place in Tbilisi almost every day since Georgia’s disputed parliamentary elections in October 2024; sounds from Parisian rallies, Munich crickets and saxophone compositions by Jakob Jentgens are part of the score. The video-installation contains fragments of the performance work (Medusa’s Ashes - Iterations) and its rehearsals, hereby functioning as a placeholder (wildcard) of the absent live-work.
