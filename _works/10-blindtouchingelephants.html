  Site-specific installation (3 rooms, theatre and cinema props; 1 daily performance, 1 hour long) at AkademieGalerie (underground gallery space inside the Munich subway station Universität)
brief: >
  A three-part shop window: lobby, waiting room, therapy studio. Three inaccessible rooms, viewable just from the outside, offer themselves to the passer-by as inactive and potential spaces. They are waiting areas where the furniture and interior decoration prescribe the actions and movements of the bodies that are expected to occupy them: sit, wait, have a glass of water, lie. The glass façade of the underground gallery separates and reflects two segments of time that flow at different speeds: that of the hurried passers-by chasing the subway, and that of the three rooms that act as static theatrical backdrops, with their walls, curtains, and staged lights. One hour every a day, from noon to 1 p.m., the gallery is made accessible to the public, while gestures of care and maintenance are performed like a ritual: vacuum-cleaning, watering plants, arranging magazines, polishing mirrors and clocks, filling glasses with fresh water. Cleaning, tidying up, preparing are transformed from habitual and casual movements into precise performative acts, repetitive as well as futile in the ever-empty spaces, slightly altering the arrangement of objects and “making room” for happenings that never come. Different levels of voyeurism and the pathologization of bodies and gazes intertwine and mirror each other between the interior and exterior of the gallery as well as between the 3 spaces.
