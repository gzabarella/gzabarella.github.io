technique: >
  Two synchronised slide projectors (80 slides each), various materials (plastic boxes, post-its, paper sheets)
brief: >
  A series of photographs, taken in a textile factory in Northern Italy and in the streets of Munich, constructs the raw material for this visual and narrative flow. Street signs, ads, handwritten instructions, logos, commonly used symbols get deconstructed, fall apart, disintegrate. Syllables and signs repeat and chase one another in this syncronised double projection, where the distinction between form and content, referent and signifier, performative instruction and accidental contingency, imprint and speech simply collapses. The room fills with the sound of the mechanic, rhythmical beat of the two slide projectors. Language becomes a failed architecture, an empty shell, a flashing nonsensical hallucination, a tiring and never-fulfilled effort to approach sentences and meaning.
