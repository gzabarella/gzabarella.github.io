brief: >
  The underground gallery space of MaximiliansForum Munich is inhabited by 6 voices that enact a text in multiple languages. The script is based on a collection of fragments (diary entries, newspapers headlines, transcriptions of slogans and banners) transcribed in the last 365 days at feminist and anti-war marches in Paris, Tbilisi and Munich. A soundscape produced together with Georgian musician Nana Takvarelia accompanies the group in its movements: a mixtape of field recordings, noises and chants collected during the anti-corruption, pro-European protests and marches that have been regularly taking place in Tbilisi since Georgia’s disputed parliamentary elections in October 2024. The performance interrogates the shifts and fractures between activist speech, international and intersectional solidarity movements, (self)-censorship, self-policing and oppression; and how the rehearsal of bodies in public space (in Germany and abroad) continuously morphs and is rearranged by memory, trauma, opportunism, and fanaticism.
