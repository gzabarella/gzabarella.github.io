brief: >
  “Velvet Arteria” ponders the states of affection and disaffection that a “general” city dweller might encounter in their experience of urban landscapes. The impossibility of perceiving the city as a linear, organic, self-explainatory object shines through. The “general” city dweller is an inexistent figure, caricaturised and desperately needed by politics, the State and market swings. Not one, but a myriad fugitive yet present, untouchable yet concrete bodies inhabit the cityscape; the narrative of the flâneur must be flipped over, as well as that of its counter-character, the generic, all-consuming mass. “Velvet Arteria”, which articulates through a video-installation and a one-time performance at sunrise in the parking lot of PLATFORM, is an exercise in understanding urban characters and who is enacting them, by manipulating, consuming and flipping images and patterns of contemporary Capitalocene. The human flood, the rush hour, the break-up, the love serenade, the sandwich-men, the mass, merchandise, modular feelings and the performing and producing of time build an askew skeleton-script for “the city”: a place lingering between collective potentials and downright catastrophe.
