brief: >
  What constitutes an exhibition room, how are infrastructures of staging, rehearsing, repeating, observing and displaying interdependent, and who has the right to appropriate a space? Such questions are debated in a series of 6 performative events that take place in different Munich laundromats (“Waschsalons”).
  6 artists take over these spaces for the duration of 2 hours each time, and display objects, sound installations, posters and leaflets, minimal performative gestures and readings. The subtle line between everyday activities and staged props and interventions is continuously discussed and problematized. The reading aloud of Albert Camus’ essay “The Myth of Sisyphus” constitutes the frame of the collective group dramaturgy, which is every time repeated following a scripted timeline
  that both transforms and hides within the regular daily flow of the Waschsalons, their customers and passers-by. As Sisyphus’ endeavour of pulling a rock uphill, forever bound to repeat the same absurd, unreasonable effort, the group proceeds throughout every slot with the repetition and displaying of the same scripted codes and objects, questioning its sporadic audience (laundromat customers as well as art connoisseurs) on issues of belonging and being-strangers, sculptures and props, hacking, parasiting and role-playing, spectacle and participation. In the 2-hours long slots the audience is invited to be bored and kill time observing, while expectations towards performativity and dramatic arcs are at stake. Camus’ text concludes,
  “The struggle itself [...] is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy”.
