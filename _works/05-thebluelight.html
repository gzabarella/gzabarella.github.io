  8 coloured children night lights, reading performance (live, 13')
brief: >
  This work functions as a dialogue and a reaction to Dan Flavin’s light installations, some of which part of the permanent collection of “Metropol Kunstraum”, where the group show took place. As a response to Flavin’s vertical, awe-inspiring, cold neon-lighted objects (as well as to the visually and physically imposing artworks by other American Minimalists like Carl Andre and Donald Judd), cheap and colorful children night lights are scattered around the exhibition space, ironically defining and marking it as a not-so-serious playground. During the opening evening, all the room lights are suddenly turned off and a bedtime story is read aloud to the visitors. The rather domestic setting of the night lights and the reading aloud brings a certain feeling of intimacy and caring “motherhood”, nonetheless generating a sense of disquiet: “The Blue Light”, an original fairytale by the brothers Grimm, is intertwined with some of the Minimalists’ strong and famous artistic statements, a violence that interrupts the quiet flow of storytelling and uncovers dark areas and unconfortable issues of this canonized chapter of art history.
