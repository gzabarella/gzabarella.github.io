brief: >
  The performance script for “Cornucopia - Apricot Girls & Mouthp* Harpies” is an object, a working tool that is both used by the 8 performers during rehearsals and the main shows and can be viewed and taken away by the audience. The A0-sized poster shows the whole script, repeated 8 times in single columns, each column intended for 1 specific performer, with his/her entries underlined and marked. The parts in bold are to be performed as a chorus (syncronously). The script becomes topographic map, architectural plan, archive of the handwritten notes of each speaker, textual index of the performance.
