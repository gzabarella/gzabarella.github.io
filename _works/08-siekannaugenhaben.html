  (She Can Have Eyes Or Not) Audioguide on headphones (stereo, 30’, on streaming on the day of the performance) together with Laura Leppert
brief: >
  “Sie kann Augen haben, oder nicht” is a 30-minutes soundtrack that acted as an audioguide on 27.03.19. On this day the collective Tatzelgroup (founded by Giulia Zabarella and Laura Leppert, with Raphael Krome, Sarah Doerfel, Annabell Lachner and Adrian Sölch) realised a series of performances and sculptural interventions under a highway underpass in Munich Freimann, also called “Tatzelwurm” (literally, “many-paws worm”). The aim of the collective was to create an experience for a limited number of participants dealing with inhospitable and unusual conditions for the presentation and the very production of live artworks. The soundtrack develops as a multi-layered narration, spoken by 3 different voices, all female, soothing and yet disturbing. Interwoven fragments try to guide the visitor (as in usual navigation devices) through and within the highway underpass, leading to its bridges and shortcuts, till the entrance of a nearby motel. Anecdotal and rather loose fragments mix with dry and pedantic dictionary entries, which construct a sort of spatial semantics, a subjective vocabulary of inhabitation and urbanism. The guidance through this massive, hostile and actually “anti-human” concrete architecture, which receives voice and body through the audioguide, becomes an archaeological exploration, a travel book.
