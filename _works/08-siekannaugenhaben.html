  Audioguide (headphones, 30-minutes soundtrack played on streaming)<br/>
  with Laura Leppert<br/>
  within the performative group project in public space “Die Kreuzung als Glücksfall” by collective Tatzelgroup, Hochbrücke Freimann, Munich
brief: >
  “Sie kann Augen haben, oder nicht” is a 30-minutes soundtrack that 
  acted as an audio guide on 27.03.19. On this day the collective Tatzelgroup 
  (co-founded by Giulia Zabarella and Laura Leppert, with Raphael Krome, 
  Sarah Doerfel, Annabell Lachner and Adrian Sölch) realised a series of performances 
  and sculptural interventions under a highway underpass in Munich Freimann, also called 
  “Tatzelwurm” (literally, “many-paws worm”). The aim of the collective was to create an 
  experience for a limited number of participants dealing with inhospitable and unusual 
  conditions for the presentation and the very production of live artworks. The soundtrack 
  develops as a multi-layered narration, spoken by 3 different voices, all female, soothing 
  and yet disturbing. Interwoven fragments try to get the visitor (as in usual navigation 
  devices) through and within the highway underpass, leading to its bridges and shortcuts, 
  till the entrance of a nearby motel. Anecdotal and rather loose fragments, sometimes 
  autobiographical, mix with dry and pedantic dictionary entries, which construct a 
  sort of spatial semantics. The guidance through this massive, hostile and actually 
  “non-human” (if not “anti-human”) architecture, which through the spoken text receives 
  voice and body, becomes an archaeological exploration, a travel book. <br/>
