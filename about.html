<p>In her (choral) performances, site-specific sound and video installations, Giulia Zabarella observes how literary tropes, metaphors, cultural heritage and linguistic misunderstandings shape perception and encounters in everyday spaces. She considers language performativity in the public and private spheres as architectural modules and theatrical mechanisms, shaped and inherited by advertising, political propaganda, and family as well as collective histories. Experimenting with how language can be inhabited, bent, transformed by bodies and rooms, she employs the theatrical object of the choir as an aesthetic, spatial device (the tight mass, the anonymous mob) as well as an acoustic machine, capable to construct sound axes in space. By working closely with friends’ and collaborators’ voices, mother languages, and bodies, she questions the writing process and a fixed notion of authorship, engaging in movements of collage, reappropriation, remix, and rehearsal. Challenging the medium of her practice, she develops forms that reveal the fragility of spatial norms and of participatory assumptions.</p>
