<hr />
<p>In empty spaces or public buildings, she observes how literary tropes, metaphors, cultural heritage and linguistic misunderstandings shape the way we speak to each other: language performativity in public and in private as architectural modules and theatrical mechanisms. She experiments with how language can be inhabited, bent, transformed by bodies and spaces; the collection and attuning of texts is the raw material of her practice. Whether becoming performances, radio pieces, video installations or stage sets, her works engage the presence of both performers and public; other bodies become the direct, primary material to immediately test out textual intuitions and build sounding axes in space. She employs the theatrical object of the choir as an aesthetic, spatial device (the tight mass, the anonymous mob) as well as a resounding, strong acoustic machine. By working with friends’ and collaborators’ voices, mother language, and bodies, she questions the writing process and a fixed notion of authorship, engaging in a practice of collage, reappropriation, remix, rehearsal. Challenging the medium of her practice, she desires forms that reveal the fragility of spatial norms and of participatory assumptions.</p>
