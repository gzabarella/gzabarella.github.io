<p><i>In empty spaces or public buildings, I observe how literary tropes, metaphors, cultural heritage and linguistic misunderstandings shape the way we speak to each other: language performativity in public and in private as architectural modules and theatrical mechanisms. I experiment how language can be inhabited, bent, transformed by bodies and spaces; the collection and attuning of texts is the raw material of my practice. My works, be they choral performances, radio pieces, installations or stage sets, often need the presence of performers: other bodies are the direct, primary material to immediately test out textual intuitions, see their effects on group dynamics and build sounding boards in space. Synchronicity, polyphony and the rough overlapping of several voices are strategies that I work with, employing the theatrical object of the choir as an aesthetic, spatial device (the tight mass, the anonymous mob) as well as a resounding, strong acoustic machine. By working with friends’ and collaborators’ voices, mother language, and bodies, I estrange myself from the texts I write and rid myself of a fixed notion of authorship. Constantly questioning the medium of my practice, I desire forms that reveal the fragility of spatial norms and participatory assumptions. </i></p>
